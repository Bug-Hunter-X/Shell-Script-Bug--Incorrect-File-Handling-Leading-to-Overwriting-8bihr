This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: accidental file overwriting within a loop. The `bug.sh` script attempts to extract the header of each `.txt` file in the current directory. However, due to incorrect variable expansion, it overwrites the original file instead of creating a new one. The `bugSolution.sh` script provides the corrected version. This example highlights the importance of careful variable handling and understanding shell expansion behavior when working with files.
